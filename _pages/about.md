Hello.!

I'm Hemanth. I'm a Deep Learning Practitioner and actively looking for Career Change.

As Infoscion, for past few years, I've been supporting Mercedes Benz R&D India to automate their IT server Infrastructure using Python and Shell scripting.

<!-- _I never imagined that I would be an AI practitioner_ until before [_Jagriti Yatra_](http://www.jagritiyatra.com/) (World's Largest Train Journey and Entrepreneurship Bootcamp on wheels), where one of my fellow traveler (Yatri, as we call) made a point on the impact of AI on our future in one of our discussions. -->

<!-- This discussion aroused curiosity in me to understand/know/learn how machines can think and decide like humans, better than humans in some cases. I started researching on how it is achieved by reading blogs on Medium, attending meetups, participating in seminars, etc.. -->

A discussion with one of my fellow yatri from [_Jagriti Yatra_](http://www.jagritiyatra.com/) (World's Largest Train Journey and Entrepreneurship Bootcamp on wheels), aroused curiosity in me to understand/know/learn how machines can think and decide like humans, better than humans in some cases. I started researching on how it is achieved by reading blogs on Medium, attending meetups, participating in seminars, etc..

More and more I explored, _**I felt that my skills can be put to good use in this domain and I choose it to be my career**_. I have taken courses on Classical(Statistical) Machine Learning and now in Deep learning where my current subject interest is towards Computer Vision.

*I believe that AI is instrumental for our future. Computer Vision and NLP play a very significant and interesting role in it. I want to be part of those who are using Deep Learning to solve real world problems*

I chose to be a **Deep Learning Practitioner** to make it possible.

**I would very much interested in assisting with defining/solving Computer Vision or NLP problem. You can contact me using the Contact me page or reach out to me via LinkedIn or Twitter.**
