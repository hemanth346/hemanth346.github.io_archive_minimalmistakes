I was inspired/motivated by a tweet to create this blog. The tweet talks about how OpenAI scholars have a blog of their own and why one should start their own. I'll list the points below

 1. Forces you to teach AI concepts (forces you to learn) 
 - raises awareness of your abilities
 - shows you're proactive

 Well, I've checked out the given link and their blogs, all most all of them have started after they became scholars. **And most importantly almost most of them are hosted on Github via github pages.**  I thought to myself maybe I should start one myself too and see how bad that can be. And I tweeted below . . .


 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hmm.. may be I should start one too..!<br>Not sure where to start or what to write about though -_- <br><br>I&#39;m going to give some serious thought to this, and decide(start?) by this weekend.! <a href="https://t.co/LceCchGQGv">https://t.co/LceCchGQGv</a></p>&mdash; hemanth346 (@hemanth346) <a href="https://twitter.com/hemanth346/status/1110435429780615169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2019</a></blockquote>

Well, here I'm trying to stick to my word.! It was not easy setting this thing up without having a local server set to verify if the site is as I want it to be. But finally I did it. 

## Key take aways

### 1. Share what you are plan to do and when you plan to do on social media
I think that sharing on twitter that I would be doing this blog by weekend has ***made me accountable to the unknown force. ***


Well here I'm just trying to do that, which I'm not very good at. 

### 2. Try do in the timeline you shared earlier

I wasn't able to set this site as easily or fastly I expected I could (Mostly because I was not able to debug the errors as I was entirely coding out of github and I was frustrated). During the setup phase it also crossed my mind on what will I be writing, will it be worth the time I spent, Will there be any readers at all.! I still don't know the answers. But ***what it takes is to just start and keep at it.*** 

I've tried multiple themes, forked and deleted multiple repositories and stuck with this one finally. Hope you like it.!


### 3. Doing is not as easy as sharing/saying.!!

### 4. Writing do increase awareness 
I was not so sure on what I will be writing, but when I think of it I guess we can always find some thing. When I come to think of it, while writing a post we tend think about it more than once to see if I can add something or if I missed anything. 

Well, I wasn't aware that I can write this takeaway/blog post.! ***;)***
