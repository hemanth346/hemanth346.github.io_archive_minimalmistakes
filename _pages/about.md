Hello.!

I'm Hemanth. I'm a Deep Learning Practitioner and actively looking for Career Change.

As Infoscion, for past 3.5 years, I've been supporting Mercedes Benz R&D India to automate their IT Infrastructure administration using Python and Shell scripting.


_I never imagined that I would be an AI practitioner_ until before [_Jagriti Yatra_](http://www.jagritiyatra.com/) (World's Largest Train Journey and Entrepreneurship Bootcamp on wheels), where one of my fellow traveler (Yatri, as we call) made a point on the impact of AI on our future in one of our discussions.

This discussion aroused curiosity in me to understand/know/learn how machines can think and decide like humans, better than humans in some cases. I started researching on how it is achieved by reading blogs on Medium, attending meetups, participating in seminars, etc..


More and more I explored, I felt that my skills can be put to good use in this domain and I choose it to be my career. I attended classes on Classical(Statistical) Machine Learning and later on Deep learning where my subject interest is towards Computer Vision.

*I believe that AI is instrumental for our future. Computer Vision and NLP play a very significant and interesting role in it. I want to be part of those who are using computer vision to solve real world problems and use those learnings to improve upon the solution for computer vision problem*

I chose to be a **Deep Learning Practitioner** to make it possible.
